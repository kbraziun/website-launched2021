There is a critical need to understand how changing climate and fire regimes will impact western landscapes and how land managers and residents can prepare for a future with more fire. My core research examines relationships between climate drivers, fire activity, forest ecosystems, and ecosystem services in western US forested landscapes during the 21st century. I aim to pursue research in collaboration with and relevant to forest and fire managers; to create reproducible science; to foster meaningful and respectful relationships with colleagues and collaborators; and to support diversity and inclusion in science.
